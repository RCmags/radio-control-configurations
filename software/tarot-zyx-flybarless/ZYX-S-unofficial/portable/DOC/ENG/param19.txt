<b>Tail deadband gyro</b>
<p>The deadband of the yaw gyro
<p>The Gyro deadband is the value used to ignore small changes coming from the gyro MEMS sensors.
<p>This avoids drifting from gyro and servo noise. Big number results in poor stability and drift. Too small a number can overwork your tail servo.
<p>Default "4" in all configurations.
